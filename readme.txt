== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What size should my images be? =

Images should be sized to match the gallery size you select (Thumbnail, Medium, Medium Large or Large). Resizing images is optional because Wordpress will do this for you but the quality of your images is impacted by the size of the original image.

= How do I add captions to my slideshow? =

When you are using the Wordpress Gallery feature, enter captions like you normally would and they will be displayed if present.
